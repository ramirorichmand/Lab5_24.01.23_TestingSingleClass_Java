# lab2401_TestingSingleClass

I created a BankAccount class that has properties such as firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, accountNumber and balance. 

I initialized the balance to start at 0. I then wrote and tested getters and setters for all these properties. 

I also created a method called deposit() that takes in an amount and updates the balance of the BankAccount, and a method called withdrawal() that takes in an amount and updates the balance of the BankAccount. 

To ensure the correctness of the methods, I created a test class that has test cases for the methods created in BankAccount class, and I ran the test cases to check if all the methods were working properly. 

Lastly, I provided a method to allow the account to pay interest.
